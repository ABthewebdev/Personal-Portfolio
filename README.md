  <h2>How it was made:</h2>
  <p>Tech used in this project: HTML, CSS, javascript.</p>
  <p>I made this project utilizing an html template and plugging in my personal information. For the projects displayed I really only displayed my four best killer     projects instead of showing every single one I have finished.</p>

  <h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
  <p>In this project I learned that more is not always better with how many lines of code I write since it can really slow down the process of the server sending a     response. I cut out some unnecessary lines that just made the codebase look messy.</p>
